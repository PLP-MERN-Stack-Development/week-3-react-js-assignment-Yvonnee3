# React.js and Tailwind CSS Assignment

# Responsive React Application with Tailwind CSS 4.1

## 1. Introduction

This project is a modern, responsive React application built to demonstrate key front-end development concepts and best practices. It showcases efficient state management using React Hooks, seamless API integration, and a fully responsive design.

The application features a Task Manager for local state persistence and an API Data Viewer fetching dynamic content from a public API, all while offering a dynamic light/dark theme toggle.

## 2. Features

* **Component Architecture:** Reusable UI components (Button, Card, Navbar, Footer) and a flexible `MainLayout`.
* **Task Manager**
* **API Integration**
* **State Management** 
* **Custom Hook** 
* **Theme Management** 
* **Responsive Design** 
* **Animations & Transitions** 

## 3. Technologies Used

* **React:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
* **Vite:** A fast build tool and development server for modern web projects.
* **Tailwind CSS 4.1:** A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs. (Note: This version uses the new CSS-first configuration via `@import "tailwindcss";` and `@theme` at-rule).
* **React Router DOM:** For declarative routing within the application.
* **`uuid`:** For generating unique IDs for tasks.
* **`prop-types`:** For runtime type checking of React props.
